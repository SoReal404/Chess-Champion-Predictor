# Chess Match Outcome Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the outcome of chess matches between top players using historical game data. Inspired by Green Codeâ€™s sports prediction videos, this project focuses on chess and leverages XGBoost to forecast match results and probabilities.

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether the White player wins, the Black player wins, or if the match ends in a draw. The workflow includes:
1. Cleaning and preparing chess game data from Lichess broadcasts.
2. Feature engineering: player Elo ratings, win rates, player IDs, round/section/game info, opening and ECO codes.
3. Training an XGBoost classifier on historical matches.
4. Predicting match outcomes with probabilities for real-world scenarios, including top players like Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, Gukesh D, Alireza Firouzja, and Levon Aronian.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Lichess Broadcast PGN Database](https://database.lichess.org/broadcast/)
- **Timeframe:** 2025
- **Format:** PGN files
- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Extracted player names, Elo ratings, results, openings, ECO codes, and rounds.
  - Encoded categorical features and calculated additional features like rating differences and win rates.
