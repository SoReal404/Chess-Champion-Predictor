# Chess Match Outcome Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the outcome of chess matches between top players using historical game data. Inspired by Green Codeâ€™s sports prediction videos, this project focuses on chess and leverages XGBoost to forecast match results and probabilities.

## Project Overview
This project predicts whether the White player wins, the Black player wins, or if the match ends in a draw. The workflow includes:
1. Cleaning and preparing chess game data from Lichess broadcasts.
2. Feature engineering: player Elo ratings, win rates, player IDs, round/section/game info, opening and ECO codes.
3. Training an XGBoost classifier on historical matches.
4. Predicting match outcomes with probabilities for real-world scenarios, including top players like Magnus Carlsen, Hikaru Nakamura, Gukesh D, Alireza Firouzja, and Levon Aronian.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Lichess Broadcast PGN Database](https://database.lichess.org/broadcast/)
- **Timeframe:** 2025
- **Format:** PGN files
- **Preprocessing:** 
  - Extracted player names, Elo ratings, results, openings, ECO codes, and rounds.
  - Encoded categorical features and calculated additional features like rating differences and win rates.

---

## Features
- `event`: Tournament/event ID
- `Rounds`, `Section`, `Games Num`: Extracted from round info
- `white_elo`, `black_elo`: Player Elo ratings
- `white_id`, `black_id`: Unique player identifiers
- `opening_encod`, `eco_endoded`: Encoded openings and ECO codes
- `white_avg_elo`, `black_avg_elo`: Average Elo of players over past matches
- `white_win_rate`, `black_win_rate`: Historical win rates
- `Rating Diff`: Difference in Elo (White - Black)

**Target:**  
- `Match_Result_Encoded`: 0 = White Wins, 1 = Black Wins, 2 = Draw

---

## Model
- **Algorithm:** XGBoost Classifier
- **Input:** Features listed above
- **Output:** Predicted match outcome and probabilities for each class
- **Training:** Historical chess matches (cleaned and preprocessed)
- **Evaluation:** Tested on real-world top-player matches from 2025

## Predictions
Example of predicted probabilities for top matches:

| White            | Black            | Predicted Probabilities (White/Black/Draw) |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Magnus Carlsen   | D. Gukesh        | [0.48, 0.25, 0.27]                        |
| Magnus Carlsen   | Alireza Firouzja | [0.46, 0.26, 0.28]                        |
| Hikaru Nakamura  | Arjun Erigaisi   | [0.47, 0.26, 0.28]                        |
| Hikaru Nakamura  | D. Gukesh        | [0.46, 0.25, 0.28]                        |
